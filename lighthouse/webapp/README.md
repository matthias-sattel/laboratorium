This webapp project is used to test lighthouse integration

## Getting Started

As this is a standard next.js application, all usual commands can be applied to it in order to build, run, test the webapp.

In addition we integrate lighthouse, so that we can audit the webapp concerning performance, seo, best practices and accessibility.

This project is used as a playground and not as a reference :-)
