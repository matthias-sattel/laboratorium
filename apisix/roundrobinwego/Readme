# Round robin we go

My first experiment is simply to route requests for the same URI to different nodes. It is straightforward to get round robin routing, as shown in the [APISIX Config](apisix_conf/apisix.yaml).

To simulate the scenario, nginx nodes run in two separate container. The third node is the APISIX Gateway. To start up the simulation, simply run
```
docker compose up
```
Requests to the same URI will then be routet round robin to one of the two nginx container.
```
➜  ~ curl http://localhost:9080/hello
Hello World from Web 1                                                                 ➜  ~ curl http://localhost:9080/hello
Hello World from Web 2                                                                 ➜  ~ curl http://localhost:9080/hello
Hello World from Web 1
